### Issues

Today I learned that I only needed 1 Schema-- Workout. Also, I am currently working on the stats page and Total Workout Duration-- this stat is currently undefined. **EDIT** The public folder was missing the definition for totalDuration!!! Had to add it. **EDIT** API-routes need to be in a certain order sometimes! The :id considered "range" as an id.
